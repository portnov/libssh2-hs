Name:                libssh2

Version:             0.2

Synopsis:            FFI bindings to libssh2 SSH2 client library (http://libssh2.org/)

Description:         This package provides FFI bindings for SSH2 client library named libssh2.
                     .
                     As of version 0.2 all blocking is handled in Haskell code
                     rather than in C code. This means that all calls are now
                     interruptable using Haskell asynchronous exceptions; for
                     instance, it is now possible to use "System.Timeout" in
                     combination with "libssh2". 
                     .
                     /Note on usage on Windows/: On Windows you MUST compile
                     your executable with @-threaded@ or 'libssh2' will NOT
                     work. We have tested 'libssh2' on Windows using 
                     <http://mingw.org/>, with <http://www.openssl.org/> and
                     <http://libssh2.org/> compiled from source (be sure to pass
                     the 'shared' option to the configure script for 'openssl'
                     to enable the shared libraries).
